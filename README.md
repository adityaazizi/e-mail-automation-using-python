# e-mail-automation-using-python

I created this project after learning programming with Python as an implementation of the basic knowledge and concepts I have acquired. With this program, we can send emails with a subject, attachment, and of course, the message content automatically to multiple recipients listed in receiver_list.txt. Of course, this program can only run on the CLI for now, and I might add a UI to make it more user-friendly in the future.

Here are some steps to run this program:<br>

1. Clone this repository to your device.<br>
2. Fill in several forms in the code such as username, app password, and attachment path.
3. Additionally, you need to create an app password following the steps [here](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en).<br>
4. If using an attachment, make sure all attachment files are placed in the attachment folder.<br>
5. Once everything is ready, run the program, and the email will be sent to all recipients listed in receiver_list.txt.<br>

Good luck! :)
